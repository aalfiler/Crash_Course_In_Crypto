## Description
Compare the 2008 and 2020 stock markets. Determine similarities and differences b/w sectors and how each was affected by the economic downturn. Additionally, pull real estate and unemployment data to determine the effect of each “crash”.

## Research Questions
- What sectors were affected least and most in each scenario? 
- Is there correlation b/w sectors?
- What similarities and differences can we draw between 2008 and 2020? Why do we see the similarities or differences if there are any?
- What timeframes in 2007 and 2020 should be analyzed?
- Do we have the ability to pull consensus data and compare to pre-/post-downturn and recovery?
- What was the recovery trend? V shaped, U, K, L? 
- Who were the winners and losers both then and now? By market cap, by industry, by geography?
